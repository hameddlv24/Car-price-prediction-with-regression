# :car: Car price prediction with regression & EDA
![Alt text](cars.PNG)


### :bulb: overview
---
I have a dataset with hundreds sample of cars and their different features.

With regression algorithm, I am going to make a model which predicts cars price.

so the road map is => preprocessing - data visulization - making regresson model - improving the model - predicting some samples.

The road map is clear, i hope you enjoy this notebook.
